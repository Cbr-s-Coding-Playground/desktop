# Cbr's Coding Playground - README.md
It's not a coding playground like codepen.io and others.
It's ONLY a coding playground if you summit a pull request if you want something in the
site. However it has to be a request I can understand.
# Template for summiting pull requests. * = Required
*[The Code]

[explain what the pull request is about]

*I understand that if my pull request did not get accepted that means that [I] can't do it
or either it's confusing and I still need to learn how to code

To make a pull request, Fork > open what file you like to edit [or make a new .html file] > edit it > Open pull request.

an example of a pull request:
